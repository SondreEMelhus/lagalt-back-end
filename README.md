## Deployment
We have deployed our back end api to Heroku. We use swagger to test our end points.
Here is a link to the swagger implementation of our API: 
https://lagalt-java-backend.herokuapp.com/swagger-ui/index.html

## Endpoints
Use the link above to see a complete list of all the endpoints of our back end api.
Most of our enteties in our database have their own controller in the api. 
Each controller has a list of endpoints for fetching and manipulating these enteties.
For instance project has GET endpoints for getting all projects, getting a project by its ID or getting a project by name. 
And GET endpoints for getting all the contributors, skills, keywords, industry of a project.
It also has a POST endpoints for adding a new project to the database. 
And it has PUT endpoints to update a project, add a skill to a project, remove a skill from a project or add a keyword to a project
